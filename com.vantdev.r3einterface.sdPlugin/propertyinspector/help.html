			<div class="sdpi-heading"><b>What does the request box button do</b></div>
			<div>
				Depending on the options set in this button, when pressed, you may request box this lap with prefered pit-options.
				In this button we have a table of pitstop-options. You can select more than one option here. If <b>'Use only toggle buttons'</b>
				is not checked, this button will use these options instead, ignoring the state of the visible toggle buttons.<br>
				<br>
				This button have two states. When pressed, it may take some time for it to finish, and it blinks between the
				two states while executing the pit-stop actions.<br>
				You can set the title and icons to your liking.
				<br>
				<br />
				There are several options for this button.<br>
				<br>
				<b>* Use only toggle buttons</b><br>
				When checked, this button will only used the options from the visible toggle buttons.<br>
				If a toggle-button is active (green outlined), it will select its option for the pit-menu.<br>
				If a toggle-button has a faint yellow outline, it deselects its option in the pit-menu if it is already active.<br>
				<br>
				<b>* Request box this lap when pressed</b><br>
				If checked, the pit-options will be set, and if successful, it requests box this lap.<br>
				Otherwise, it only changes the pit-options in the menu.<br>
				<br>
				<b>* Close pit menu when finished</b><br>
				If pit-stop actions in the menu is set successfully, the pit-menu will be closed if this is checked.<br>
				<br>
			</div>

			<div class="sdpi-heading"><b>What does the toggle button do</b></div>
			<div>
				The purpose of the toggle button is to toggle which pit-stop action you want to do before you request box this lap.
				You can only select one pit-option for this button. The option selected will be active for the pitstop-
				request when the button has a green outline, and not active when the button has a faint yellow outline. Note that
				the pit-options will not be applied directly ingame when the toggle-buttons is pressed. The ingame pitstop-options is set
				when a request box button is pressed.
				You can set the title of the toggle-button to whatever you want, preferably similar to the set option,
				and you can also set the different background icons for the different states.
				<br>
			</div>
			<div class="sdpi-heading"><b>When it fails</b></div>
			<div>
				If you request box this lap and some options are not available in the pit-menu, the pit-stop execution may stop
				and leaving the pit-menu open, even if the <b>'Close pit menu when finished is checked'</b> in the request box button.<br>
				The purpose for this is to notify the driver some important pitstop-options did not work.<br>
				<br>
				This will happen when:<br>
				<br>
				these options are active or not:<br>
				* Change tires<br>
				* Refuel<br>
				<br>
				these options are active:<br>
				* Serve penalty<br>
				* Driver change<br>
				<br>
				The fix options (bodywork, suspension and so on) will be ignored, even if active.<br>
